## Transcribe or take notes on your item.

To transcribe or take notes on your item, click in the bottom pane of the item view and begin typing. Your notes autosave as you type. You can come back to the notes pane at any time to continue to edit your notes. Notes attach to individual photos or selections within your item, rather than the item itself, but you can always see a list of your notes in the notes pane on the lefthand side of the item view.



#### Notes Formatting Toolbar

* Superscript
* Subscript

* Enumerated list

Several formatting actions are taken for you automatically, including creating em and en dashes.

Tropy items can have as many notes as you want. To add a new note, click the + on the notes pane.
