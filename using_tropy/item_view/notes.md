## Transcribe or take notes on your item.

To transcribe or take notes on your item, click in the bottom pane of the item view and begin typing. Your notes autosave as you type. You can come back to the notes pane at any time to continue to edit your notes. Notes attach to individual photos or selections within your item, rather than the item itself, but you can always see a list of your notes in the notes pane on the lefthand side of the item view.

### Notes Formatting Toolbar

You can format your notes using the toolbar at the top of the notes pane. Select the text you want to format and click the button on the toolbar. Functions available for formatting are:

* Boldface
* Italic
* Underline
* Strikethrough
* Block quote
* Superscript
* Subscript
* Bulleted list \(the last two buttons allow you to have multiple levels of indent on your lists for both bullet and enumerated lists\)
* Enumerated list

Several formatting actions are taken for you automatically, including creating em and en dashes. To remove the automatic formatting, press Backspace \(Delete for macOS\) immediately after the keystroke that creates the automatic formatting. Your text will then revert to the original keystroke.

### Multiple Notes

Tropy items can have as many notes as you want. To add a new note, click the + on the notes pane. This functionality allows you to both transcribe and take notes on your items and keep all your work in one place.
