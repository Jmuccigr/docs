## Combine multiple photos into one item

Tropy items can include one or multiple photos.

If you want to add photos to an item, and those photos are not already in Tropy, then right-click on the item you want to add photos to. Select *Add photo* and select one or more photos from your file system. Click *Open*. The photo will be added to your item; you can see it in the righthand pane under Photos.

If your photos are already in Tropy, you can combine them into items easily. You have two options for creating multi-photo items.

1. **Drag and drop**: Drag an item on top of another item to combine them into one item.

2. **Right-click**: Hold down the Command/Ctrl key, then click on each item. Right-click, then click *Merge selected items* from the drop-down menu.



### Merging metadata

Metadata conflicts: When you merge two items that have different metadata, Tropy automatically resolves metadata conflicts this way:

1. If you drag and drop, the target metadata is retained.

2. If you Ctrl+click and use the right-click menu, the metadata from the top item is retained.

Additional metadata: If a metadata field is filled out in one item but is not filled out in others, then the filled metadata field is applied to the entire item.

All merge operations can be undone. You can undo from the top menu, under *Edit*, or by right-clicking on an item and selecting *Undo* from the menu.
