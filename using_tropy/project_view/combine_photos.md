## Combine multiple photos into one item

Tropy items can include one or multiple photos, making it easy to group multi-page documents. All photos within an item share the same metadata. Merging is not intended to collect multiple different documents, but rather to combine multiple photos that belong to the same document. **Grouping items into topical or organizational collections is best done with lists or tags.**

* You can easily combine items within Tropy.

  1. **Drag and drop**: Drag an item on top of another item to combine them into one item.

* If you want to add photos to an item, and those photos are not already in Tropy, then you have two options.

  1. Right-click on the item you want to add photos to. Select *Add photo* and select one or more photos from your file system. Click *Open.* The photo will be added to your item; you can see it in the item pane under Photos.
  2. In the item pane under photos, click the +. Select one or more photos, and click *Open*. 


### Merging metadata

Metadata conflicts: When you merge two items that have different metadata, Tropy automatically resolves metadata conflicts this way:

1. If you drag and drop, the target metadata is retained.

2. If you Ctrl+click and use the right-click menu, the metadata from the top item is retained.

Additional metadata: If a metadata field is filled out in one item but is not filled out in others, then the filled metadata field is applied to the entire item.

All merge operations can be undone. You can undo from the top menu, under *Edit*, or by right-clicking on an item and selecting *Undo* from the menu.
