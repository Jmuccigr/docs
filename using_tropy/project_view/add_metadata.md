## Add metadata to items

To add metadata to your item, click on it to select it. Then you have several options for adding metadata.

1. Enter your metadata information in the metadata pane on the righthand side of the window. Press Enter or Tab to save your information and move on.

2. While your item is selected in the center pane, click again on the field you wish to edit. Once youâ€™ve completed your entry, press Enter or Tab to save your information and move on.

3. Double-clicking on your item in the central pane will bring you to the item view, where you can also edit the metadata, now in the lefthand pane.

You can also edit the metadata for multiple items at a time. Ctrl/Command+click on each item you want to edit; then input your metadata into the metadata pane on the righthand side. The metadata you input will be applied to all items you have selected.
