## Add metadata to items

To describe the content of a photograph, Tropy uses customizable metadata templates with multiple fields for different properties of the content of your photo, for example, title, date, author, box, folder, collection, archive, and rights. 

**Beta note**: In the beta, metadata templates are not customizable. In Tropy 1.0, you will be able to create and edit templates.

To add or edit metadata to describe your item, click on it to select it. In the metadata pane on the righthand side of the project view, select a template from the pull-down menu. Then you have several options for adding information.

1. Enter your metadata information in the metadata pane on the righthand side of the window. Press Enter or Tab to save your information and move on.

2. While your item is selected in the center pane, click again on the field you wish to edit. Type in your information. Once youâ€™ve completed your entry, press Enter or Tab to save your information and move on.

3. Double-clicking on your item in the item table will bring you to the item view, where you can also edit the metadata, now in the lefthand pane.

You can also edit the metadata for multiple items at a time. Ctrl/Command+click on each item you want to edit; then type your metadata into the metadata pane on the righthand side. The metadata you input will be applied to all items you have selected.
