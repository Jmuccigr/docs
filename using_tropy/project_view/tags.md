## Using Tags

Tags are useful for delineating subjects, organization, content highlights, and many other uses. To maximize your tags' usefulness, you should check the tag list before creating a new tag to make sure you don't already have that tag \(with a different capitalization or part of speech, for instance\).

### Create a new tag.

To add tags to an item, click to the tags tab of the metadata pane. Select _Add Tag_, then type your new tag name. Press Enter to save your tag. That tag now appears in the tag list in the sidebar, as well as in the tags tab of the metadata pane.

You can also add a new tag to a group of items. Ctrl/Command+click or Shift+click to select the items, and then click on the tags tab of the metadata pane. Select _Add Tag_, then type your new tag name. Press Enter to save your tag. The tag is now applied to all the items you have selected.

To access all of your items tagged with a particular tag, click on the tag name in the sidebar.

### A**dd a tag that already exists.**

You have two options for adding a tag that already exists. You can either \(1\) drag and drop your item onto the tag in the sidebar; or \(2\) right-click on the item, then move to _Tags_ and select the tag you wish to apply. You can also add tags in bulk, by selecting multiple items and then either dragging and dropping or selecting a tag from the right-click menu.

### Re**name an existing tag.**

You have two options for renaming a tag.

1. In the tag list in the  left menu, right-click on the tag, and select _Rename tag._ Enter the new tag name and hit return. The tag will be renamed in all the items to which it has been applied.

2. In the Tags tab of the metadata pane, right-click on the tag, and select _Rename tag._ Enter the new tag name and hit return. The tag will be renamed in the tags list in the left menu and in all the items to which it has been applied.

### R**emove a tag.**

In the tags tab of the metadata pane, click on a tag to select it and then press Backspace to remove a tag from an item.

### D**elete a tag completely.**

In the sidebar, right-click on a tag and select _Delete tag. _

### Assign your tag a color.

Once you have created a tag, you can assign it a color. In the tag list in the sidebar, right-click on the tag name and navigate to Change Color. If you assign a color to a tag, items with that tag will receive a small colored circle in grid view so that you can easily see which items have colored tags.
