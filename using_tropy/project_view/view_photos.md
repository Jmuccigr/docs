## View photos in project view.

In project view, you can view your items in a list or in a photo grid. To switch between these views, use the slider at the top of the center pane.

If you are viewing your photos as a list, you can sort the list by column. Just click on the name of the column you want to sort by. The arrow \(^\) indicates which column your items are sorted by and whether they are sorted ascending \(^\) or descending \(Ë‡\).
