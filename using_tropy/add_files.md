## Add photos to Tropy.

When you import a photo, Tropy makes a copy of the photo. The original photo remains in its original location on your hard drive. You have several options for adding photos to your project.

1. Navigate to *File* &gt; *Import photos*. You can select one photo from your files, or using Shift+click or Ctrl/Command+click, you can select multiple photos. To select all photos in a folder, type Ctrl/Command+A. Then click *Open* in the dialog box.

2. Click the + in the menu bar above the item table in project view.

2. From your computer’s file system, navigate to the folder where your photos are, and select one or more photos. Then drag those photos into the middle pane of Tropy in order to add them.

**Note:** At this time, Tropy does not support drag-and-drop from Apple’s photo software, including iPhoto and Photos.app. To get photos from Photos, export your photos to a different location on your computer and then follow the steps above.



You may want to add an item that does not yet have any photos attached to it. To do so, go to *File* &gt; *New* &gt; *Item*. You can then add photos to that item just as you would add photos to an item that already contains photos.

  
**Note for Beta**: The beta version of Tropy is intended only for testing. You will NOT be able to migrate your photos from this version to later beta versions or to version 1.0. Given this, we recommend that you don’t upload large numbers of photos when testing the beta version.
