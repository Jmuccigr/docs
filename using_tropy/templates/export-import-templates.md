## Exporting Templates

Once you have created a template, you can export it so others can use it as well.

Click on the fifth button in the template header.

This will open a dialog box. From there, you can save your template. The default filename is the name you gave to your template. The file format is .ttp.

## Importing Templates

You can import templates from others. Any .ttp file can be imported into Tropy. Click on the fourth button in the template header. In the dialog box that opens, navigate to wherever you have the .ttp file saved, then click _Open_.

The imported template now appears in the Template dropdown box in the template header.
