## Vocabularies

You can add vocabularies to Tropy's list of metadata vocabularies in order to use them in your metadata templates. The vocabularies must be in .ttl or .n3 file format. You can see a large list of vocabularies that should import easily into Tropy [here](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs).
