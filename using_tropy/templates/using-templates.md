## What are metadata templates?

Metadata templates are forms that you select or create that allow you to record information about your items in ways that are actually useful to you. You can select from the templates that are provided in Tropy, or you can create your own. Before you begin creating your own template, we do recommend that you **browse through the available templates to see if one can be adapted to your needs**; it's easier to add to an existing template than to start from scratch.
