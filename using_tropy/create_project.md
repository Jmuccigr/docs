## Create a new project.

A project is a collection of photographs. You can only have one project open in Tropy at any given time, which means that you cannot move photos from one project to another within Tropy. For that reason, it usually makes sense to conceive of a project in broad terms: a project as a book or thesis, not a chapter. You can use lists, tags, and/or notes to organize material within a Tropy project.

**From the menu bar**: Click on _File_ &gt; _New_ &gt; _Project_.

**To change where your project is saved**: Click on _Change file name and location_ in the “Create new project” dialog box. Then select a new location. You can also rename the file so that the name of the project is different from the name of the file. Then click _Save_ to return to the "Create new project" dialog box. When you have named your project, click _Create project_.
