## Transitioning from beta to 1.0

If you have been using the beta version of Tropy, your projects and photos should migrate into Tropy 1.0 with no problems. However, there are a few steps you should take in order to retain all the work you've done in the beta.

* First, make a backup of all your projects in the beta.
* Export any custom templates and vocabularies you may have created in the beta.
* Download and install the 1.0 version.
* Import your custom templates and vocabularies into the 1.0 version. \(You'll have to create an empty project in order to access the templates.\)
* Open your project file from the beta. If you have imported your custom templates, your items should appear with the proper template.
* Select all your items, right-click, and select _Consolidate selected items_. This will tell the 1.0 version where your original photos are.

And you're ready to work with the 1.0 version!
