## Export from Tropy

Tropy items can be exported as JSON-LD.

### Export from Tropy.

To export from Tropy, right-click on an item in the item table. From the right-click menu, select Export Item. This action will open a dialog box, where you can save your JSON file onto your computer. To export multiple items, Ctrl/Command+click or Shift+click to select multiple items. Then right-click and select Export Selected Items.

At present, Tropy only exports metadata, not associated photos. Your photos still exist outside Tropy as well, since importing in Tropy copies your photos.
